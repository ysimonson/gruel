# Performance Tracking Branch

This document describes the `perf` branch workflow for storing benchmark history.

## Overview

Benchmark results are stored on a dedicated `perf` branch to avoid cluttering the main branch with frequent updates. CI runs benchmarks in parallel across platforms and a collector job aggregates results before pushing atomically to the `perf` branch.

**Architecture (ADR-0031 Phase 1-4):** The workflow uses artifact-based collection with atomic pushing, time-based batching, and commit range tracking. Individual platform jobs upload artifacts, and a single collector job downloads all artifacts, enhances them with commit range metadata (version 2 schema), and pushes to perf branch once. Time-based batching (scheduled runs + cancellation) handles high commit velocity by ensuring only the most recent commits are benchmarked.

## Branch Structure

The `perf` branch contains:
- `benchmarks/history.json` - Complete benchmark history

## Workflow

### CI Workflow (Automated)

**Current (Phase 1-4 - Parallel execution with atomic collection, time-based batching, and commit range tracking):**

1. Benchmarks are triggered by:
   - **Push to trunk**: Triggered on every commit (older queued runs are canceled)
   - **Scheduled**: Every 15 minutes to ensure coverage
   - **Manual**: workflow_dispatch for on-demand runs

2. When triggered:
   - Three platform jobs run in parallel (x86-64-linux, aarch64-linux, aarch64-macos)
   - Each job:
     - Runs `./bench.sh --no-history --output /tmp/results.json`
     - Uploads results as artifact: `benchmark-results-{commit_sha}-{platform}.json`
   - Collector job runs after all platform jobs complete:
     - Downloads all platform artifacts
     - Checkouts perf branch
     - Appends each platform's results to its history file
     - Commits and pushes once (atomic push, no race conditions)

3. **Time-based batching (Phase 3)**:
   - If multiple commits arrive rapidly, older queued runs are canceled
   - Only the most recent commit in the queue is benchmarked
   - Scheduled runs (every 15 minutes) ensure no commits are missed completely

4. **Commit range tracking (Phase 4)**:
   - Each benchmark result includes a commit_range field (version 2 schema)
   - Tracks all commits in the last 24 hours that this benchmark represents
   - Includes benchmark_reason field: "push", "scheduled", or "manual"
   - Enables bisecting regressions across commit ranges

**Legacy (Before Phase 1):**

1. On each commit to `trunk`:
   - Three platform jobs ran sequentially (max-parallel: 1)
   - Each job directly pushed to perf branch (caused race conditions and throughput bottleneck)

### Local Workflow (Manual)

To run benchmarks locally and update history:

```bash
# Run benchmarks (auto-appends to website/static/benchmarks/history.json)
./bench.sh

# Or save to specific file without updating history
./bench.sh --no-history --output my-results.json

# Manually append to history
./scripts/append-benchmark.py my-results.json website/static/benchmarks/history.json
```

### Website Build

During website deployment:
1. Fetch `history.json` from `perf` branch
2. Copy to `website/static/benchmarks/history.json`
3. Generate charts from history (Phase 5)
4. Build website with Zola

## Why a Separate Branch?

- **Reduced noise**: Benchmark commits don't clutter main branch history
- **Simplified permissions**: CI can push to `perf` without main branch protection issues
- **Easy rollback**: Benchmark history can be reset without affecting code
- **Clean separation**: Code changes and performance data are independent

## History Retention

- Maximum 100 benchmark runs are retained
- Older results are automatically pruned by `append-benchmark.py`
- This limits `history.json` to approximately 100KB

## Manual Maintenance

> **Note:** The commands below use git to manage the `perf` branch,
> which is managed by GitHub Actions CI and exists only on the remote.

To reset benchmark history:
```bash
# Delete and recreate perf branch
git branch -D perf
git checkout --orphan perf
echo '{"version": 1, "runs": []}' > benchmarks/history.json
git add benchmarks/history.json
git commit -m "Reset benchmark history"
git push -f origin perf
```

To view current history:
```bash
git show perf:benchmarks/history.json | jq '.runs | length'
```
