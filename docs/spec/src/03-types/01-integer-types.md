# Integer Types

## Signed Integer Types

{{ rule(id="3.1:1", cat="normative") }}

A signed integer type is one of: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, or `isize`.

{{ rule(id="3.1:2", cat="normative") }}

The type `i8` represents signed integers in the range [-128, 127].

{{ rule(id="3.1:3", cat="normative") }}

The type `i16` represents signed integers in the range [-32768, 32767].

{{ rule(id="3.1:4", cat="normative") }}

The type `i32` represents signed integers in the range [-2147483648, 2147483647].

{{ rule(id="3.1:5", cat="normative") }}

The type `i64` represents signed integers in the range [-9223372036854775808, 9223372036854775807].

{{ rule(id="3.1:23", cat="normative") }}

The type `isize` is a signed integer type whose size equals the target platform's pointer size. On 64-bit targets, `isize` has the same range as `i64`.

{{ rule(id="3.1:6", cat="dynamic-semantics") }}

Signed integer arithmetic that overflows **MUST** cause a runtime panic.

{{ rule(id="3.1:7") }}

```gruel
fn main() -> i32 {
    let a: i8 = 127;
    let b: i16 = 32767;
    let c: i32 = 2147483647;
    let d: i64 = 9223372036854775807;
    0
}
```

## Unsigned Integer Types

{{ rule(id="3.1:8", cat="normative") }}

An unsigned integer type is one of: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, or `usize`.

{{ rule(id="3.1:9", cat="normative") }}

The type `u8` represents unsigned integers in the range [0, 255].

{{ rule(id="3.1:10", cat="normative") }}

The type `u16` represents unsigned integers in the range [0, 65535].

{{ rule(id="3.1:11", cat="normative") }}

The type `u32` represents unsigned integers in the range [0, 4294967295].

{{ rule(id="3.1:12", cat="normative") }}

The type `u64` represents unsigned integers in the range [0, 18446744073709551615].

{{ rule(id="3.1:24", cat="normative") }}

The type `usize` is an unsigned integer type whose size equals the target platform's pointer size. On 64-bit targets, `usize` has the same range as `u64`.

{{ rule(id="3.1:13", cat="dynamic-semantics") }}

Unsigned integer arithmetic that overflows **MUST** cause a runtime panic.

## Integer Literal Type Inference

{{ rule(id="3.1:14", cat="normative") }}

An integer literal without explicit type annotation defaults to type `i32`.

{{ rule(id="3.1:15", cat="normative") }}

When an integer literal appears in a context where the expected type is known (e.g., assignment to a typed variable), the literal is inferred to have that type.

{{ rule(id="3.1:16") }}

```gruel
fn main() -> i32 {
    let x = 42;           // x has type i32 (default)
    let y: i64 = 100;     // 100 is inferred as i64
    0
}
```

## Integer Literal Range Validation

{{ rule(id="3.1:17", cat="legality-rule") }}

A compiler **MUST** reject programs where an integer literal value exceeds the representable range of its target type.

{{ rule(id="3.1:18", cat="normative") }}

When an integer literal is the operand of a unary negation operator, and the negated value would be representable in the target signed integer type, the expression is valid even if the literal value itself exceeds the positive range of that type. This allows the minimum value of each signed integer type to be written as a negated literal.

{{ rule(id="3.1:19") }}

```gruel
fn main() -> i32 {
    let a: i8 = -128;                       // valid: -128 is in i8 range
    let b: i8 = 128;                        // error: 128 exceeds i8 range
    let c: i32 = -2147483648;               // valid: i32 minimum value
    let d: i64 = -9223372036854775808;      // valid: i64 minimum value
    0
}
```

{{ rule(id="3.1:20") }}

```gruel
fn main() -> i32 {
    let x: i8 = 128;           // error: literal out of range for i8
    let y: u8 = 256;           // error: literal out of range for u8
    let z: i32 = 9999999999;   // error: literal out of range for i32
    0
}
```
