# Comments

{{ rule(id="2.2:1", cat="normative") }}

Line comments begin with `//` and extend to the end of the line.

```ebnf
line_comment = "//" { any_char_except_newline } newline ;
```

{{ rule(id="2.2:2", cat="normative") }}

Comments are discarded during lexical analysis and do not affect program semantics.

{{ rule(id="2.2:3") }}

```gruel
// This is a comment
fn main() -> i32 {
    42  // This is also a comment
}
```

{{ rule(id="2.2:4") }}

Block comments (`/* ... */`) are not currently supported.
