//! Shared liveness analysis types and utilities for register allocation.
//!
//! This module provides target-independent types for liveness analysis.
//! Each backend implements its own `analyze()` function that populates
//! these types based on its specific instruction set and control flow.
//!
//! The analysis computes which virtual registers are "live" (their values
//! may still be used) at each program point. This information is used by
//! the register allocator to determine when registers can be reused.
