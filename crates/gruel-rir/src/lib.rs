//! Gruel Intermediate Representation (RIR) - Untyped IR.
//!
//! RIR is the first IR in the Gruel compiler pipeline. It is generated from
//! the AST and represents a lowered, linearized form of the program.
//!
//! Key characteristics:
//! - Untyped: type information is not yet resolved
//! - Per-file: generated for each source file
//! - Dense encoding: instructions stored in arrays, referenced by index
//!
//! Inspired by Zig's ZIR (Zig Intermediate Representation).
